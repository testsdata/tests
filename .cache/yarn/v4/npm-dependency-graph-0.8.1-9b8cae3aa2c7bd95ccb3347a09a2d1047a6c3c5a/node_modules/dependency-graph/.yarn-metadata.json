    "readme": "# Dependency Graph\n\nSimple dependency graph\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is a simple dependency graph useful for determining the order to do a list of things that depend on certain items being done before they are.\n\nTo use, `npm install dependency-graph` and then `require('dependency-graph').DepGraph`\n\n## API\n\n### DepGraph\n\nNodes in the graph are just simple strings with optional data associated with them.\n\n - `addNode(name, data)` - add a node in the graph with optional data. If `data` is not given, `name` will be used as data\n - `removeNode(name)` - remove a node from the graph\n - `hasNode(name)` - check if a node exists in the graph\n - `size()` - return the number of nodes in the graph\n - `getNodeData(name)` - get the data associated with a node (will throw an `Error` if the node does not exist)\n - `setNodeData(name, data)` - set the data for an existing node (will throw an `Error` if the node does not exist)\n - `addDependency(from, to)` - add a dependency between two nodes (will throw an `Error` if one of the nodes does not exist)\n - `removeDependency(from, to)` - remove a dependency between two nodes\n - `clone()` - return a clone of the graph. Any data attached to the nodes will only be *shallow-copied*\n - `dependenciesOf(name, leavesOnly)` - get an array containing the nodes that the specified node depends on (transitively). If `leavesOnly` is true, only nodes that do not depend on any other nodes will be returned in the array.\n - `dependantsOf(name, leavesOnly)` - get an array containing the nodes that depend on the specified node (transitively). If `leavesOnly` is true, only nodes that do not have any dependants will be returned in the array.\n - `overallOrder(leavesOnly)` - construct the overall processing order for the dependency graph. If `leavesOnly` is true, only nodes that do not depend on any other nodes will be returned.\n\nDependency Cycles are detected when running `dependenciesOf`, `dependantsOf`, and `overallOrder` and if one is found, a `DepGraphCycleError` will be thrown that includes what the cycle was in the message as well as the `cyclePath` property: e.g. `Dependency Cycle Found: a -> b -> c -> a`. If you wish to silence this error, pass `circular: true` when instantiating `DepGraph` (more below).\n\n## Examples\n\n    var DepGraph = require('dependency-graph').DepGraph;\n\n    var graph = new DepGraph();\n    graph.addNode('a');\n    graph.addNode('b');\n    graph.addNode('c');\n\n    graph.size() // 3\n\n    graph.addDependency('a', 'b');\n    graph.addDependency('b', 'c');\n\n    graph.dependenciesOf('a'); // ['c', 'b']\n    graph.dependenciesOf('b'); // ['c']\n    graph.dependantsOf('c'); // ['a', 'b']\n\n    graph.overallOrder(); // ['c', 'b', 'a']\n    graph.overallOrder(true); // ['c']\n\n    graph.addNode('d', 'data');\n\n    graph.getNodeData('d'); // 'data'\n\n    graph.setNodeData('d', 'newData');\n\n    graph.getNodeData('d'); // 'newData'\n\n    var circularGraph = new DepGraph({ circular: true });\n\n    circularGraph.addNode('a');\n    circularGraph.addNode('b');\n    circularGraph.addNode('c');\n    circularGraph.addNode('d');\n\n    circularGraph.addDependency('a', 'b');\n    circularGraph.addDependency('b', 'c'); // b depends on c\n    circularGraph.addDependency('c', 'a'); // c depends on a, which depends on b\n    circularGraph.addDependency('d', 'a');\n\n    circularGraph.dependenciesOf('b'); // ['a', 'c']\n    circularGraph.overallOrder(); // ['c', 'b', 'a', 'd']\n",
