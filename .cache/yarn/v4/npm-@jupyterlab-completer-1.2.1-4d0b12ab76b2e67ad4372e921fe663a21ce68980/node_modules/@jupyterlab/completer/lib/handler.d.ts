     * If a sub-class reimplements this method, then that class must either call
     * its super method or it must take responsibility for adding and removing
     * the completer completable class to the editor host node.
     *
     * Despite the fact that the editor widget adds a class whenever there is a
     * primary selection, this method checks independently for two reasons:
     *
     * 1. The editor widget connects to the same signal to add that class, so
     *    there is no guarantee that the class will be added before this method
     *    is invoked so simply checking for the CSS class's existence is not an
     *    option. Secondarily, checking the editor state should be faster than
     *    querying the DOM in either case.
     * 2. Because this method adds a class that indicates whether completer
     *    functionality ought to be enabled, relying on the behavior of the
     *    `jp-mod-has-primary-selection` to filter out any editors that have
     *    a selection means the semantic meaning of `jp-mod-completer-enabled`
     *    is obscured because there may be cases where the enabled class is added
     *    even though the completer is not available.
