    "readme": "# It Opens Stuff\n\nThat is, in your desktop environment. This will make *actual windows pop up*, with stuff in them:\n\n```bash\nnpm install opener -g\n\nopener http://google.com\nopener ./my-file.txt\nopener firefox\nopener npm run lint\n```\n\nAlso if you want to use it programmatically you can do that too:\n\n```js\nvar opener = require(\"opener\");\n\nopener(\"http://google.com\");\nopener(\"./my-file.txt\");\nopener(\"firefox\");\nopener(\"npm run lint\");\n```\n\nPlus, it returns the child process created, so you can do things like let your script exit while the window stays open:\n\n```js\nvar editor = opener(\"documentation.odt\");\neditor.unref();\n// These other unrefs may be necessary if your OS's opener process\n// exits before the process it started is complete.\neditor.stdin.unref();\neditor.stdout.unref();\neditor.stderr.unref();\n```\n\n\n## Use It for Good\n\nLike opening the user's browser with a test harness in your package's test script:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"opener ./test/runner.html\"\n    },\n    \"devDependencies\": {\n        \"opener\": \"*\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Why\n\nBecause Windows has `start`, Macs have `open`, and *nix has `xdg-open`. At least [according to some guy on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/1480971/3191). And I like things that work on all three. Like Node.js. And Opener.\n",
