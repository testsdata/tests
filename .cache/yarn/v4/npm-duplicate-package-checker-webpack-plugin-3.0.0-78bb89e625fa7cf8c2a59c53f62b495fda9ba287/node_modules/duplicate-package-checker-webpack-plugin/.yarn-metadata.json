This situation may happen without any warning, resulting in extra bloat in your bundle and may lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n\nThis plugin will warn you of such cases to minimize bundle size and avoid bugs caused by unintended duplicate packages.\n\nMotivation: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/385 and https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/646.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install duplicate-package-checker-webpack-plugin --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nAdd the plugin to your webpack config:\n\n```js\nvar DuplicatePackageCheckerPlugin = require(\"duplicate-package-checker-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [new DuplicatePackageCheckerPlugin()]\n};\n```\n\nYou can also pass an object with configurable options:\n\n```js\nnew DuplicatePackageCheckerPlugin({\n  // Also show module that is requiring each duplicate package (default: false)\n  verbose: true,\n  // Emit errors instead of warnings (default: false)\n  emitError: true,\n  // Show help message if duplicate packages are found (default: true)\n  showHelp: false,\n  // Warn also if major versions differ (default: true)\n  strict: false,\n  /**\n   * Exclude instances of packages from the results.\n   * If all instances of a package are excluded, or all instances except one,\n   * then the package is no longer considered duplicated and won't be emitted as a warning/error.\n   * @param {Object} instance\n   * @param {string} instance.name The name of the package\n   * @param {string} instance.version The version of the package\n   * @param {string} instance.path Absolute path to the package\n   * @param {?string} instance.issuer Absolute path to the module that requested the package\n   * @returns {boolean} true to exclude the instance, false otherwise\n   */\n  exclude(instance) {\n    return instance.name === \"fbjs\";\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Strict mode\n\nStrict mode warns when multiple packages with different **major** versions (such as `v1.0.0` vs `v2.0.0`) exist in the bundle.\n\nPackages with different major versions introduce backward incompatible changes and require either interventions on third-party packages or unsafe workarounds (such as resolving differing package major versions dependencies with a single version).\n\nIt is suggested that strict mode is kept enabled since this improves visibility into your bundle and can help in solving and identifying potential issues.\n\n## Resolving duplicate packages in your bundle\n\nThere are multiple ways you can go about resolving duplicate packages in your bundle, the right solution mostly depends on what tools you're using and on each particular case.\n\n### Webpack `resolve.alias`\n\nAdd an entry in [`resolve.alias`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-alias) which will configure Webpack to route any package references to a single specified path.\n\nFor example, if Lodash is duplicated in your bundle, the following configuration would render all Lodash imports to always refer to the Lodash instance found at `./node_modules/lodash`.\n\n```\nalias: {\n  lodash: path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/lodash'),\n}\n```\n\n**Note: Aliasing packages with different major versions may break your app. Use only if you're sure that all required versions are compatible, at least in the context of your app**\n\n### Yarn `install --flat`\n\nYarn allows [flat installations](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/install/#toc-yarn-install-flat) (`yarn install --flat`) which will only allow one version of each package to be installed.\n\n### Yarn resolutions\n\nIf you want more control over your overridden dependency versions and don't feel like using `yarn install --flat`, yarn supports [\"selective version resolution\"](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions) which allows you to enforce specific versions for each dependency.\n\n**package.json**\n\n```\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"lodash\": \"4.17.0\",\n    \"old-package-with-old-lodash\": \"*\"\n  },\n  \"resolutions\": {\n    \"old-package-with-old-lodash/lodash\": \"4.17.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### NPM Dedupe\n\nIf you use NPM and not Yarn, you can try running `npm dedupe`. NPM **may** leave multiple versions of the same package installed even if a single version satisfies each [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) of all of its dependants.\n\n### Bump your dependencies\n\nIf your project is using an old version of a package and a dependency is using a newer version of that package, consider upgrading your project to use the newer version.\n\n### File issues!\n\nIf your project has a dependency and it's using an outdated version of a package, file an issue and notify the author to update the dependencies. Let's help keep our projects green and our applications secure, performant and bug-free!\n\n## Webpack versions\n\n### Webpack 3.x\n\n`npm install duplicate-package-checker-webpack-plugin@^2.1.0 --save-dev`\n\n### Webpack 4.x\n\n`npm install duplicate-package-checker-webpack-plugin`\n\n[downloads-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/duplicate-package-checker-webpack-plugin.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/duplicate-package-checker-webpack-plugin\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/duplicate-package-checker-webpack-plugin.svg\n",
