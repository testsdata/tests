    "readme": "Jupyter Offline Notebook\n========================\n\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/manics/jupyter-offlinenotebook/master?filepath=example.ipynb)\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jupyter-offlinenotebook.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupyter-offlinenotebook)\n\nSave and load notebooks to browser storage, even if you've lost your connection to the server.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    pip install jupyter-offlinenotebook\n\nThis should automatically enable the extension. If it is not listed in `jupyter nbextension list` or `jupyter serverextension list` install and enable it:\n\n    jupyter nbextension install --py jupyter_offlinenotebook --sys-prefix\n    jupyter nbextension enable --py jupyter_offlinenotebook --sys-prefix\n\n    jupyter serverextension install --py jupyter_offlinenotebook --sys-prefix\n    jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyter_offlinenotebook --sys-prefix\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n![Offline notebook buttons](./offline-notebook-buttons.png)\n\nYou should see up to five new buttons depending on your configuration and where you are running the notebook:\n- download the in-memory (browser) state of the notebook\n- save the in-memory state of the notebook to local-storage\n- load a notebook from local-storage\n- open the permanent URL of the repository containing this notebook\n- copy the permanent mybinder URL to share this repository\n\nSaving and loading uses the repository ID and the path of the current notebook.\n\nYou should always see the `Download` button.\nIf you are running this on mybinder all buttons should be visible.\nSee the configuration section below to enable the other buttons on other systems.\n\nIf you don't see the buttons check the Javascript console log.\n\nSee [example.ipynb](./example.ipynb)\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nThis extension can be configured in `jupyter_notebook_config.py` by setting the following properties of `c.OfflineNotebookConfig`:\n- `repository_id`:\n  A callable that returns the repository ID.\n  This is used when storing and retrieving notebooks.\n  Default is the value of the `BINDER_REPO_URL` environment variable.\n- `repository_ref_url`:\n  A callable that returns the repository reference URL.\n  Default is the value of the `BINDER_REF_URL` environment variable.\n- `binder_persistent_url`:\n  A callable that returns the repository reference URL.\n  Default is the values of the `BINDER_LAUNCH_HOST` and\n  `BINDER_PERSISTENT_REQUEST` environment variables.\n- `binder_repo_label`:\n  A callable that returns the label used to link to the repository.\n\n\nJupyterLab Extension\n====================\n\nThe JupyterLab extension is still under development.\nTo try it out:\n\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/manics/jupyter-offlinenotebook/master?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fexample.ipynb)\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jupyter-offlinenotebook)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jupyter-offlinenotebook)\n\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    pip install jupyter-offlinenotebook\n    jupyter labextension install jupyter-offlinenotebook\n\n\nWarning\n=======\n\nThis extension is still in development.\nIt is only tested on Firefox.\nBreaking changes may occur in future.\n\nThere are [several major limitations](https://github.com/manics/jupyter-offlinenotebook/issues) including:\n\n- Local-storage is limited by quotas imposed by the browser.\n- A repository ID and path of the notebook within Jupyter Notebook are used, joined by a ` `.\n  This may change in future.\n\n\nDevelopment notes\n=================\n\nThis extension stores notebooks in browser storage using the [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), wrapped with [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/).\n\nOne server API call is made during initialisation to obtain the storage configuration.\nEverything else is done client-side so should work even if the server is disconnected.\n\nJupyter Notebook:\n\n    pip install .\n\nJupyter Lab:\n\n    jlpm\n    jupyter labextension link\n\nTagged releases of this repository are automatically published to Pypi and NPM by Travis.\n",
